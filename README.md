An awfully useless weechat plugin. Fullwdith text!
-----------

## Installing

1. Copy/symlink script as `~/.weechat/python/fullwidth.py`
3. Run `/script load fullwidth.py` in weechat
4. Amuse yourself with your new ability to write ＬＩＫＥ　ＴＨＩＳ.

Optional:

Symlink into `~/.weechat/python/autoload` to load automatically.

## Using fullwidth.py

Simply use the command like so:

    /fw THE CANDY HORSE NEEDS SNUGGLES~

 to produce the output:
 
    ＴＨＥ　ＣＡＮＤＹ　ＨＯＲＳＥ　ＮＥＥＤＳ　ＳＮＵＧＧＬＥＳ～
    
There's really nothing to it.
